## File Operations:

1. Create the following directory structure.

```
hello
+-- five
¦   +-- six
¦       +-- c.txt
¦       +-- seven
¦           +-- error.log
+-- one
    +-- a.txt
    +-- b.txt
    +-- two
        +-- d.txt
        +-- three
            +-- e.txt
            +-- four
                +-- access.log
```

`hello`, `one`, `two`, `three`, `four`, `five`, `six`  and `seven` are directories. The remaining items are empty files.
 
Sol:

mkdir hello && cd hello && mkdir five && mkdir one && cd one
touch b.txt && touch a.txt && mkdir two && cd two && touch d.txt && mkdir three && cd three && touch e.txt && mkdir four && cd four && touch access.log
cd ../../../../ && cd five 
mkdir six && cd six && touch c.txt && mkdir seven && cd seven && touch error.log



2. Print the locations of all the `txt` files in `hello` and its subdirectories.

Sol: find . -type f -name "*.txt"


3. Delete all the files with the `.log` extension.

Sol: find . -type f -name "*.log" -delete


4. Add the following content to `a.txt`

```
Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.
```
Sol: echo "Unix is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&T Unix, development starting in the 1970s at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others." > a.txt


5. Compress the `hello` directory into a `zip` file

Sol: zip -r hello.zip ./hello

6. Copy all the `contents` of `hello` into another directory called `world`

Sol:1) cp -r hello/* world (in the same directory) 
    2) cp -r hello/* ./world(if world is in another directory.)

7. Delete the `hello` directory
 1)rm -r hello
 2)rmdir hello
